        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            From a very early age I always knew that I wanted to be...a scientist. You thought I was going to say
            software engineer huh? Don't worry I'm gonna get to that.
            I'm pretty sure you're a busy person, so to make a long story short, how I ended up wanting to become a
            software engineer was quite honestly by taking a leap of faith and diving head first into something new.
            After much deliberation I eventually decided to attend a coding bootcamp; and that's where I had my
            epiphany.
            I never actually viewed coding or Computer Science as an 'authentic' field of science until I attended
            Flatiron School of Software Engineering. While there, I came to realize that coding requires calculations,
            predictions, experimentation, testing, discovery, and most importantly...<b>curiosity</b>; all the things I
            enjoyed about being a scientist.
            Software engineers are scientists! That realization made me want to become a software engineer. I guess in a
            way I always wanted to be a
            software engineer and without knowing it.
        </p>

            As far as software I would like to create in the future(besides creating web apps of course),I'm really
            intersted in getting into mobile developement and possibly build a few useful apps or an annoyingly
            addictive game. I'm also interested in getting involved with machine learning or even exploring VR. But
            that'll most likely be a bit further into the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I am fortunate enough to be selected for this internship, I would really like to learn how to communicate
            effectively in a professional team environment among more experienced developers. I think good communication is one of
            the most
            crucial skills a software dev--well actually anyone for that matter--can learn. I'm also interested in
            learning what I can expect when joining an existing project and how different phases of product developement
            (from idea to exucution) is accomplished in a professional environment.
